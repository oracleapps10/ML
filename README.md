Campaign for selling personal loans.

This case is about a bank (XYZ Bank) which has a growing customer base. Majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. 
The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.
The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
